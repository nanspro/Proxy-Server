                                                  Computer Networks Assignment 2 - Proxy Server

-> The Proxy Server has been implemented in python language.

-> All the cached files are stored in a folder named CACHE which is automatically created when the proxy server is run.

-> To start the proxy server write the commmand "python proxy.py <port_number>" .

-> The proxy server is started at localhost and at the input port number.

-> The main server is running at localhost and port 20000

-> Use the proxy server using curl command "curl -x http://127.0.0.1:<port_number> â€‹ http://127.0.0.1:20000/<file_name>"

-> The data of the file is output on terminal.

-> Folder contains an attached screenshot of the curl command and the output shown on the terminal.

-> Features Implemented :
      - Error handling is done.
      - Caching is implemented.
      - No more than 3 files/responses can be cached.
      - If a new file is requested and the cache is full then the oldest file is removed from cache.
      - If a file is modified then file gets updated in cache too.
      - Multiple requests can be handled to the proxy server.
      - Threading is implemented so that multiple clients can send requests at once.
